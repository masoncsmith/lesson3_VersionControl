            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning control uses a central server, also called the main repository, where one or more developers can contribute to a single project at the same time. This set up allows for team members to “check out” files, make changes, and commit them back to the repository, solving the issue of file sharing without waiting for or overwriting another person’s work, and keeping an organized version history of a project whose files can be revisited and updated and any time. Using a repository also allows for multiple people to edit a file at the same time and merges the changes when they are committed to the repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Manually managing the versioning control of a project would be a huge undertaking and would be nearly impossible to do, but thanks to Version Control Systems, that’s not something we have to worry about. VCSs handle a ton of operations, such as: keeping track of who changes what and when they change it, knowing what changes, and merging a file that 2 or more people were working on simultaneously. Another major benefit of VCSs is that when files are updated, the old ones aren’t overwritten, they save the old versions and allow you to even go back and work on an older version of your project.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free, open sourced Versioning Control System (VCS) that is fast and flexible, allowing multiple developers to work together on a singular project without having to physically meet or exchange files. What separates Git from other software creation managers is that it features a branching model, where individuals can branch off of the main project, edit the files, and then merge them back to the main branch. What makes Git so much faster is the way it performs all of its operation on your local repository, and only has to upload the finished product to the remote repository, resulting in much less data being transferred and fewer instances of having to connect to the remote repo.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Using Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Without the use of third party software, Git can be very confusing, especially when it’s your first time using it. The main thing to know about the Git workflow is that your files are moved between 3 stages when you add them to your local repository, which then needs to be pushed to your remote repository. When you’re working on a file locally, it is your working copy. When you’re finished working on that file and want to move it to your local repository, it needs to be moved to your staging area, which is like a shopping cart of files to be committed to the repo together. Once the desired files have been moved to the staging area, they can be committed to the local repository, and then pushed to your remote repo.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Usually used with Git projects, GitHub hosts remote repositories that takes away a lot of the cost and technical overhead that is normally needed to set up a remote server and maintain it. GitHub also has a bunch of features that make using Git much easier in the ways that it keeps provides a visual interface for those who aren’t familiar with Git’s command line interface. One of the most important aspects of GitHub is its web-based interface that can be accessed from any device, along with providing many useful, timesaving features for tracking bugs, requesting features, managing certain tasks, and it even allows for each project to have its own wiki for documentation.</p>
